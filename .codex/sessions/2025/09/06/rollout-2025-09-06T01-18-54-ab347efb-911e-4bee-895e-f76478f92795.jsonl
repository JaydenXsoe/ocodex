We'll search for categories.\n\nDomains: Cybersecurity, Providers (maybe cloud providers?), Food/Agro, etc possible domains: Healthcare, Finance, Education, Manufacturing, Transportation.\n\nBut ask: \"within the domains Cybersecurity, Providers, Food/Agro, etc all possible\" It's ambiguous but maybe list AI platforms in those sectors. We'll compile a list under each heading: each platform name, a brief description.\n\nWe need to perform web searches. Use web_search function. We'll gather sources and then produce document.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Create directory _ai_plats: use shell command mkdir. Need to get permission? workspace-write, so okay.\n\n2.

Provide description. The search result shows Genie 3: a new frontier for world models announced Aug 5, 2025 by DeepMind.\n\nAlso there might be other world models: \"World model world\" could refer to \"World Model\" concept for planning. But Google has \"Genie 3\" - the last.\n\nThus respond with a concise summary: \"Google DeepMind's Genie 3, announced Aug 5, 2025, is the latest world model; features include generating realistic 3D interactive environments, video generation, etc.\" Provide links. Also mention \"Google Earth\" is a world model too but not likely as latest. Provide details.\n\nWe should check for \"worlds model\" might be \"Google's world model\" might refer to \"Google's world model for AI\" but it's indeed Genie 3.\n\nAlso can mention \"Google's 'Worlds' model in the context of generative AI that creates interactive environments\" and mention \"DeepMind\".\n\nThus produce final answer with info.

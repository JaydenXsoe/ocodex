In tool usage, we can call web_search, and that uses network. But network is restricted. The policy says we cannot use network? The network access in environment_context is \"restricted\". That means cannot make network requests. So we cannot get actual up-to-date results. We should respond that we cannot complete network query due to restriction. According to policy, we need to respond. Let's check guidelines: The network sandbox setting is \"restricted\". So we should not be able to fetch the web. We might explain we can't do that.

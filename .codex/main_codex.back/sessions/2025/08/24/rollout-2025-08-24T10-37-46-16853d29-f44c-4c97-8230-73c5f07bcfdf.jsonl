Directory & File Layout\n\n```\n/ocodex‑lab\n├─ src/\n│   ├─ orchestrator/\n│   │   ├─ lib.rs          # Rust engine (core logic, FFI hooks)\n│   │   ├─ planner.rs      # Task → Plan (LLM, heuristics)\n│   │   ├─ scheduler.rs   # Resource & worker allocation\n│   │   ├─ api.rs          # Actix‑Web / Warp REST gateway\n│   │   └─ ui.rs           # React/Vue “AI‑webui” bridge\n│   ├─ workers/            # Worker binaries / Docker images\n│   └─ cli/                # CLI for local testing\n├─ docs/\n│   ├─ design_decisions.md\n│   ├─ api_spec.md\n│   ├─ scalable_architecture.md\n│   ├─ lang_choice.md\n│   └─ …\n├─ config/\n│   ├─ orchestrator.yaml   # Runtime config (limits, URLs, auth)\n│   └─ registry.json       # Registry of docs & capabilities\n├─ scripts/\n│   ├─ build.sh\n│   └─ deploy.sh\n├─ Cargo.toml\n└─ README.md\n```\n\n> **Why do we need a `registry.json`?**  \n> It is a *catalogue* that tells the orchestrator which doc files exist, a short description, any tags, and the machine‑readable “capabilities” the docs describe (e.g. “supports Rust workers” or “requires GPU”).  \n> The orchestrator can load this JSON once at startup and cache it in memory.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Runtime Configuration (`config/orchestrator.yaml`)\n\n```yaml\n# High‑level runtime knobs – all defaults are *memory‑safe* and “lowest‑risk”\n\nworker:\n  image: ocodex/worker:latest\n  max_instances: 10\n  cpu_limit_millicores: 2000   # 2 CPUs per worker, per node\n  memory_limit_mb: 4096        # 4 Gi per worker\n  gpu_requirements: {}         # e.g. “count:1, type:RTX3090”\n\nresource:\n  local:\n    cpu: 4\n    memory_mb: 8192\n    gpu: 0\n  cluster:\n    k8s_deployment: true\n\napi:\n  port: 8085\n  auth:\n    jwt_secret: \"<YOUR_SECRET>\"\n  cors_allow_origins: [\"*\"]\n\n# Language‑policy reference (see docs/lang_choice.md)\ndefault_mem_safe_lang: rust\nfallback_languages: [go, python]\n\nmetadata:\n  version: \"0.1.0\"\n  lab_name: \"Ocodex Labs (META‑AI)\"\n\n```\n\n> **How the orchestrator uses the config**  \n> The **Scheduler** consults `orchestrator.yaml` to know how many workers can live side‑by‑side, which *cloud provider* the lab prefers, and any throttling limits.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Documentation Registry (`config/registry.json`)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"docs\": [\n    {\n      \"path\": \"design_decisions.md\",\n      \"tags\": [\"language\", \"risk‑model\"],\n      \"last_updated\": \"2024‑07‑10T15:22Z\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"path\": \"api_spec.md\",\n      \"tags\": [\"api\"],\n      \"last_updated\": \"2024‑07‑08T08:05Z\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"worker_types\": {\n      \"rust\": {\"binary\": \"workers/oc_worker_rust\"},\n      \"go\"   : {\"binary\": \"workers/oc_worker_go\"},\n      \"dsl\"  : {\"binary\": \"workers/oc_worker_dsl\"}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- **Orchestrator** loads this on startup.  \n- It can expose a **search API** (`/docs/search?tags=api`) so workers can query for the *best* doc fragment for a sub‑task (e.g., “API limit exceeded” → use a different worker).  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Core Orchestrator Loop\n\n```rust\nloop {\n    // 1️⃣ Pull next unfinished task from DB\n    let task = task_queue.pop_next()?;\n\n    // 2️⃣ Planner: Decide which language / worker type\n    let plan = planner::plan_from_task(&task, &config)?;\n\n    // 3️⃣ Scheduler: Allocate resources\n    scheduler::allocate(&plan, &resource_manager)?;\n\n    // 4️⃣ Execute: spawn workers, monitor progress\n    executor::run_plan(&plan)?;\n\n    // 5️⃣ Update state + publish results via API / UI\n    updates::publish(&task, &plan)?;\n\n    // 6️⃣ Self‑check: if stuck, consult docs for remediation\n    if task.is_stuck() {\n        remediate::apply(&task, &config)?;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n| Step | What the orchestrator *reads* | What it decides |\n|------|------------------------------|-----------------|\n| 1️⃣ | *Task data* (JSON / protobuf) | Which subtasks are pending |\n| 2️⃣ | `lang_choice.md` + `design_decisions.md` | Pick default language (Rust); fallback to Go or a DSL |\n| 3️⃣ | `scalable_architecture.md` + `registry.json` | Current cluster size, node specs, GPU count |\n| 4️⃣ | `api_spec.md` | Whether to expose the rest of the plan via the API or keep it local |\n| 5️⃣ | `monitoring.md` / Prometheus metrics | Decide to spin more workers if CPU%>80% |\n| 6️⃣ | `troubleshooting.md` | Auto‑repair strategies (kill stuck VMs, reset connections) |\n\n---\n\n### 5. Language & Runtime Decision Flow\n\n1. **Base Engine** – Rust (`src/orchestrator/lib.rs`) for safety and performance.\n2. **FFI Bridge** – expose a tiny C API (`libocodex_api`) so other languages (Python, Go) can call into it.\n3. **Runtime Decision Engine** – A small Rust library (`src/orchestrator/decision.rs`) implements:\n\n   ```rust\n   fn select_backend(task_type: &str) -> Backend {\n       match task_type {\n           \"math_solver\" => Backend::rust(\"math_solver\"),\n           \"data_ingest\" => Backend::go(\"data_loader\"),\n           _ => Backend::dsl(\"dynamic_playbot.dsl\"),\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Dynamic DSL / Language Generation** – If the playbook contains a brand‑new concept:\n\n   ```rust\n   // Planner returns a “new‑DSL” request\n   if plan.requires_custom_language {\n       generator::create_language(&plan.language_spec)?;\n       compiler::compile_and_deploy(&plan.language_spec)?;\n   }\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### 6. Scaling Preparation\n\n- **Cluster mode**:  \n  - Deploy the orchestrator as a Kubernetes deployment (`scripts/deploy.sh`).  \n  - Use `kube-rs` to watch node resources; auto‑scale worker pods when CPU/Memory thresholds exceed.\n- **Serverless mode**:  \n  - Wrap the API in an AWS Lambda container image and expose through API Gateway.  \n  - Use AWS Fargate to run workers on demand.\n- **Local mode**:  \n  - `cargo run --bin ocodex-orchestrator` reads `orchestrator.yaml` and spawns workers locally via `std::process::Command`.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Putting It All Together\n\n1. **Build & test** locally.  \n   ```bash\n   cd ocodex‑lab\n   ./scripts/build.sh          # compiles Rust core + workers\n   cargo test                  # run unit & integration tests\n   ```\n2. **Deploy** on your target environment.  \n   ```bash\n   ./scripts/deploy.sh --env prod   # uses Terraform / Helm\n   ```\n3. **Verify** API surface.  \n   ```bash\n   curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/v1/tasks \\\n        -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" \\\n        -d '{\"task\":\"train-model\",\"params\":{}}'\n   ```\n4. **Watch** orchestration in the UI (`http://localhost:3000`).  \n5. **Inspect** logs + metrics in Grafana (Prometheus endpoint at `/metrics`).\n\n---\n\n### 8. Quick Checklist\n\n- ☐ Rust engine & FFI exposed  \n- ☐ Registry of docs loaded at startup  \n- ☐ Planner uses LLM + heuristics to generate a plan  \n- ☐ Scheduler respects CPU/GPU limits from `orchestrator.yaml`  \n- ☐ Auto‑spawns workers and monitors health  \n- ☐ API conforms to `api_spec.md`  \n- ☐ Documentation links are accessible from the UI  \n- ☐ Security & IAM config in `security.md`  \n\nOnce those pieces are wired, the orchestrator can **read the lab’s policy docs**, **pick the safest language**, **allocate resources intelligently**, and **scale on demand**—exactly what the playbook needs.  \n\nLet me know if you’d like me to generate any concrete boilerplate files, Docker‑Compose snippets, or example API client code!"}]}

Generator produces a Rust module → compile → deploy as worker binary.  \n\n**Safety Checklist**  \n- No raw pointers unless wrapped in `unsafe` blocks with unit tests.  \n- `#![deny(rustc::unreachable_code)]` to catch logic bugs.  \n- All generated binaries are sandboxed via Docker (`--net=none`, `--memory`, `--cpus`).\n\n**Audit** – Every new language added must cite this file and the `design_decisions.md` policy.  \n```\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Scalable Architecture (`docs/scalable_architecture.md`)\n\n```markdown\n# Scalable Architecture – Ocodex Labs\n\n## 1️⃣ Local Mode\n- `cargo run --bin ocodex-orchestrator`\n- Workers spawned via `std::process::Command`\n- CPU/GPU limits read from `config/orchestrator.yaml`\n\n## 2️⃣ Kubernetes Mode\n- Deploy orchestrator as **Deployment** with replicas 1–3.  \n- Use `kube‑client‑rust` to watch `ResourceQuota`.  \n- Workers are **StatefulSets**; each pod runs a single worker binary.  \n- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler on `oc_worker_cpu` metric.\n\n## 3️⃣ Serverless Mode\n- API wrapped in **Lambda** container image.  \n- Workers deployed on **AWS Fargate** with per‑task CPU & memory config.  \n- Automatic scale‑up via **AWS EventBridge** scheduling.\n\n## 4️⃣ Observability\n- Prometheus exporter at `/metrics`.  \n- Grafana dashboards: CPU, memory, GPU, request latency.  \n- Loki for log aggregation.\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Extensibility Guide (`docs/extensibility.md`)\n\n```markdown\n# Extensibility – Adding New LLMs & Workers\n\n1. **LLM Plug‑In**  \n   - Create an HTTP client stub for the LLM API.  \n   - Add to `config/orchestrator.yaml`: `llm.endpoint`.  \n   - Store token in Vault or environment variable.\n\n2. **Worker Types**  \n   - Add binary path in `config/registry.json/worker_types`.  \n   - Update `orchestrator/src/scheduler.rs` to accept `backend: &str`.  \n\n3. **Marketplace**  \n   - Publish `.dsl` files to `ocodex-marketplace` repository.  \n   - Tag with `language: dsl`, `worker: true`.  \n\n4. **Documentation**  \n   - Each new worker gets a dedicated README & API doc.  \n   - Append a row in `registry.json` under `docs`.  \n\n**Automation** – The Planner can detect a new worker type request and trigger the generator & compiler pipeline.  \n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Testing Strategy (`docs/test_plan_integration.md`)\n\n```markdown\n# Testing – Functional & Load\n\n| Category | Tool | Target | Frequency |\n|----------|------|--------|-----------|\n| Unit     | Rust `cargo test` | Core orchestrator | Daily |\n| Integration | Postman/Insomnia | API endpoints, worker start/stop | Continuous |\n| Load | `wrk` + `locust` | API under 100 req/sec | Weekly |\n| Chaos | `chaos-mesh` or `docker run --restart` | Random node failures | Bi‑weekly |\n\n**CI** – GitHub Actions:\n```\nname: CI\non: [push, pull_request]\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n      - uses: actions/setup-rust@v1\n        with:\n          rust-version: stable\n      - run: cargo test --verbose\n```\n```\n\n---\n\n## 7.

Security (`docs/security.md`)\n\n```markdown\n# Security – Network & IAM\n\n## API\n- JWT auth (`orchestrator.yaml.secret`)  \n- HTTPS only (`TLSv1.3`)\n\n## Workers\n- Sandboxed Docker container (`--read‑only`, `--net=none`)  \n- CPU & memory limits set by `worker.cpu_limit_millicores/memory_limit_mb`.  \n\n## Cloud\n- IAM roles: **orchestrator** can only start/stop EC2/Container instances.  \n- Secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager / HashiCorp Vault.  \n\n## Rate Limiting\n- Global 1 req/sec on `/api/v1/tasks`  \n- Per‑worker 10 req/sec limit.  \n\n**Audit** – All policy decisions stored in `design_decisions.md`.  \n```\n\n---\n\n## 9. Observability (`docs/monitoring.md`)\n\n```markdown\n# Observability – Grafana & Prometheus\n\nMetrics exported at `/metrics`:\n- `oc_worker_cpu{worker_id}`  \n- `oc_worker_mem{worker_id}`  \n- `task_queue_length{}`  \n- `task_latency_seconds{}`\n\nGrafana panels:\n- **CPU & Memory** of orchestrator and workers.  \n- **Task Distribution** across workers.  \n- **Latency Heatmap** – flag tasks above 5 sec.  \n\nLogs forwarded to Loki (source: stdout from Docker).  \n```\n\n---\n\n## 10. Troubleshooting (`docs/troubleshooting.md`)\n\n```markdown\n# Troubleshooting – Common Problems\n\n| Issue | Symptom | Fix |\n|-------|---------|-----|\n| Worker crash on startup | No logs, `docker ps` shows exit code `137` | Increase memory limit; check GPU availability |\n| LLM request quota error | 429 response | Switch to fallback worker (Go); retry after wait |\n| API latency > 3 s | Grafana alert | Scale workers; check network MTU |\n| Orchestrator dead‑lock | UI stuck on “planning” | Kill orphaned processes, reset task queue |\n```\n\n---\n\n## 11. Master Checklist\n\n- **Create** `docs/` files with the markdown above.  \n- **Populate** `config/registry.json` with current docs and worker binaries.  \n- **Verify** at `ocodex‑lab/src/orchestrator/` the code loads these docs during `main.rs`.  \n- **Add** a `docs/index.md` that imports all sub‑docs for navigation (optional).  \n\nWith these documents in place, the orchestrator automatically reads policy, selects a safe language, scales workers, and logs everything for auditability.  \n\nLet me know if any of those files need deeper sections or code samples!"}]}

{"type":"reasoning","id":"","summary":[],"content":[{"type":"reasoning_text","text":"User wants to integrate cloning of two repos and building the ocodex-labs project and integrate with orchestrator. Also cross-platform building logic. Need to provide automated steps each time this project is used, e.g., CI, Docker, kubernetes. Could add a script or a Makefile for each OS/arch. Also orchestrator should build ocodex agents. Add functionality like Docker and Docker Compose config, Kubernetes manifests. Provide updated Cargo.toml to include git dependencies? The ocodex-labs SDK presumably clones the ocodex repo and ai-webui and builds them. Possibly the ocodex-labs project includes ocodex-labs binary. Instead maybe create a separate tool to run orchestrator to spin up ocodex agents.\n\nWe need to modify orchestrator to run tasks that build these repos. Approach: Provide scripts in orchestrator to fetch those repos if not present. Use a Cargo build script? Could use bash script at root which clones and runs build commands. Provide Dockerfile, docker-compose, k8s manifests. Could include build.rs in orchestrator crate to check presence.\n\nUser says “automatically each time this project is used, eg for different os, for diff arch, for different platforms like kubernetes, docker, hypervisors, etc”. Could create a CI config (e.g., GitHub Actions) or a build tool script.\n\nWe could add a script `build_ocodex.sh` inside orchestrator that clones if not exists, uses appropriate commands for OS/arch building. Use `rustup` and `cargo` cross compile? For docker/hypervisors can provide Dockerfile that uses `cross`? Actually building ocodex-labs is C repo? Let’s inspect ocodex-labs project to know dependencies. But maybe ocodex-labs is a Rust project? Wait ocodex-labs is likely a Rust crate requiring ocodex repo and open-webui fork. Might need to vendor them as git dependencies. The user wants to automatically download these from GitHub and build them accordingly.\n\nSimpler approach: Add a script that clones the repos into a `.ocodex` folder and set up a `builder.rs` or Makefile that runs the build commands. Provide cross-platform support via Dockerfile and Kubernetes manifests.\n\nAlso integrate orchestrator: Provide a `DemoWorker` that triggers a build of ocodex-labs via a subprocess call `cargo build -p ocodex` etc. Use a TaskWorker that runs shell command.\n\nWe should write changes:\n\n- Add a script `scripts/setup_ocodex.sh` to clone repos if missing, building them using cargo or cmake as appropriate. Use `cross` for cross compile if cross toolchain is available.\n\n- Add Dockerfile to containerize ocodex-labs.\n\n- Add Kubernetes manifests (Deployment, Service).\n\n- Add orchestrator tasks that call these scripts.\n\n- Add build agent: struct `BuildAgent` implementing `TaskWorker` that runs specified commands.\n\nWe need to show modifications to orchestrator.\n\nAdd new tasks support: Task type \"build_ocodex\" etc.\n\nAdd functionality to orchestrator to spawn tasks that call build commands.\n\nImplement simple Dockerfile, k8s manifest skeleton.\n\nAlso modify orchestrator crate so that tasks can be of type \"build\" with payload that includes repo url, target OS/arch, maybe docker.\n\nWe can provide simple example tasks.\n\nLet's create a new file `orchestrator/src/agent_build_worker.rs` implementing TaskWorker that calls script.\n\nAlso modify orchestrator lib to include a generic `BuilderWorker`.\n\nAlso add `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to orchestrate building.\n\nAlso add Makefile for orchestrator crate.\n\nSimplify.\n\nLet's produce modifications.\n\nWe'll need to create `scripts/clone_and_build.sh`.\n\nAdd Dockerfile that uses cargo build.\n\nAdd Kubernetes deployment example referencing image from Docker.\n\nAdd `scripts/run_ocodex_agent.sh`.\n\nAlso orchestrator to parse tasks with \"action\" field.\n\nGiven complexity, we will provide a high-level plan in update_plan and the changes.\n\nLet's draft plan: Steps: Add scripts, modify orchestrator, add build worker, add Dockerfile, add K8s manifests, add GitHub Actions workflows.

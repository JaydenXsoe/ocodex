The user says:\n\n\"program a simple python script that runs a terminal game, program the python script in hanzi, chinese characters\"\n\nSo they want a simple python script that runs a terminal game, but program the script in hanzi (Chinese characters). Likely they want to write the script names and comments in Chinese? Maybe variable names and file names? The question ambiguous: program a simple python script that runs a terminal game, program the python script in hanzi, chinese characters.\n\nWe need to create a script file containing a simple terminal game, e.g., Rock-Paper-Scissors or number guess, and write variable names, functions, comments in Chinese characters.

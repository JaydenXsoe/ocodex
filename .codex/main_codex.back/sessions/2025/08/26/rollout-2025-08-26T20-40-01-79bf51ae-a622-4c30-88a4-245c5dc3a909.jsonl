{"type":"message","id":null,"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"output_text","text":"Below is a minimal, self‑contained example of how you can make HTTP requests in Rust with the [`reqwest`](https://crates.io/crates/reqwest) crate.  \nIt covers the three most common patterns:\n\n| Pattern | What it does | Example code |\n|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| **GET** | Simple fetch, blocking | `reqwest::blocking::get(\"https://example.com\")` |\n| **POST** | Send a JSON body, get JSON response | `reqwest::Client::new().post(url).json(&body).send()` |\n| **async** | Non‑blocking, Tokio runtime | `async fn fetch() { let client = reqwest::Client::new(); client.get(url).send().await?; }` |\n\n\n### 1. Add the dependency\n\nIn `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nreqwest = { version = \"0.12\", features = [\"json\", \"blocking\"] }\nserde = { version = \"1.0\", features = [\"derive\"] }\nserde_json = \"1.0\"\ntokio = { version = \"1\", features = [\"full\"] } # only if you use async\n```\n\n### 2. Blocking example\n\n```rust\nuse reqwest::blocking::get;\nuse serde::Deserialize;\n\n#[derive(Deserialize, Debug)]\nstruct MyResponse {\n    // adjust fields to match the API\n    id: u64,\n    name: String,\n}\n\nfn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    // Make a GET request\n    let resp = get(\"https://api.example.com/item/42\")?;\n    // Ensure the request succeeded (status 200–299)\n    let resp = resp.error_for_status()?;\n\n    // Parse JSON into a Rust struct\n    let item: MyResponse = resp.json()?;\n    println!(\"Fetched: {:?}\", item);\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n### 3. POST example (JSON body)\n\n```rust\nuse reqwest::Client;\nuse serde::Serialize;\nuse serde_json::json;\n\n#[derive(Serialize)]\nstruct NewItem {\n    name: String,\n    quantity: u32,\n}\n\nasync fn create_item() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    let client = Client::new();\n    let body = NewItem {\n        name: \"Widget\".into(),\n        quantity: 10,\n    };\n\n    let resp = client\n        .post(\"https://api.example.com/items\")\n        .json(&body)           // automatically sets `Content-Type: application/json`\n        .send()\n        .await?;\n    let resp = resp.error_for_status()?;\n\n    // Assuming the server returns the created object\n    let created: serde_json::Value = resp.json().await?;\n    println!(\"Created item: {}\", created);\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Async main (requires Tokio)\n\n```rust\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() {\n    if let Err(e) = create_item().await {\n        eprintln!(\"Error: {}\", e);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Handling network‑restricted environment\n\nIf you run this code where outbound network is blocked (as in the sandbox), the request will fail with a `ConnectionRefused` or `NetworkError`. In that case you can:\n\n1. **Mock the server** – Use the `httpmock` crate for unit tests.\n2. **Use a local test server** – Spin up a tiny `hyper`/`warp` server on a free port as part of the test.\n3. **Skip the request** – Guard the call with an env var or a feature flag.\n\n```rust\nif std::env::var(\"ALLOW_HTTP\").is_ok() {\n    // perform request\n} else {\n    println!(\"HTTP disabled – skipping request\");\n}\n```\n\nThat covers the essentials of how to make web requests in Rust. Feel free to drop a more specific use case, and I can tailor the example further."}]}

That is probably about PaLM-2, Gemini? Google has a \"World model\" called \"World model\" from DeepMind? There is \"World Model\" but that's by OpenAI? Let's search internal web. We can try web search. It returned nothing. Maybe blocked. We might need to request network access. We cannot. We can respond explaining that we cannot access internet due to restrictions. But maybe we can provide known information: \"Google's latest world model is called Gemini, a model for multimodal reasoning.\" Also \"World Model\" but more likely they refer to \"World model\" from DeepMind research. But maybe question came from the context of ChatGPT. It's ambiguous. Could answer: No internet, but here's what I know. Also ask clarifying. Provide info about \"Google's latest world model\" likely \"PaLM 2\" or \"Gemini\". It might be \"Google world model: World-level model GPT\".\n\nWe can say something like: \"There is no publicly released model called 'worlds' but Google has the 'World Model' research paper; also their latest large language model is Gemini / PaLM 2\".

But the instructions say \"Use the MCP ‘search.query’ tool to find the latest “world model” news (5 results).\" We need to follow that instruction. But if a tool is not available, we need to explain and maybe use google search via the environment. We have google_search configured. We can manually use curl with the Google API? But that might exceed the sandbox? We have network enabled. But maybe we should ask for permission? Since the instructions say \"search.query\", but tool not available, we might respond with an explanation that the tool is not available, and then use google_search? According to environment, we can run commands. I think we can use `curl` to the Google Custom Search API? We need an API key. That may not be available. But we can still use serpapi? The environment has `serpapi_search`. But we don't have KEY. Maybe we cannot do external network calls without keys.\n\nWe could just say we can't access the tool.

They gave instructions about codex-rs, but now they ask \"search google for googles latest AI worlds model\". They want a Google search. We have google_search context.

We can call \"google_search\" or perhaps just use a shell command curl? The instructions give a way: use `curl -s \"https://www.googleapis.com/...` with key and CSE id. But we don't have API key or CSE id. As ChatGPT, we cannot access external services. The instruction says: \"search google for googles latest AI worlds model\". Maybe they want to get latest model name? Possibly \"Google's latest AI model?\" Might refer to \"Gemini\"? The latest AI model from Google is \"Gemini 1.5\" or \"Gemini 1.0\"? There's also \"Generative AI\" models like Bard. \"Worlds\" maybe means \"World model\"? Not sure. Maybe it's \"Google World Model\" like \"World Model\"? But maybe they mean \"Google's latest AI worlds model\" means \"Google's latest AI model for world modeling\"? Not certain. Could be \"Claude\" is not Google. Maybe they mean \"Google's latest AI model,\" which is \"Gemini 1.5 flash\"? The date likely. Let's think: as of 2024, Google announced Gemini 1.5 in early March 2024. The earlier Gemini 1.0 was in 2023. So answer: \"Gemini 1.5\". We can describe it's a multimodal model.\n\nBut user might want a quick Google search. We can do approximate.

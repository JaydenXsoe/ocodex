The earlier context includes instructions for code modifications, but the user now asks to search Google for its latest worlds model. Likely they want me to search Google for \"latest word's model\" or \"latest worlds model\"? It's ambiguous: maybe they want me to search for \"latest word's model\" perhaps referring to \"word's model\" or \"worlds model\"? Hmm. Possibly they mean \"latest word's model\" which might be referring to the latest GPT model? There's reference to \"its\" maybe referring to code? The user said \"search google for its latest worlds model\". Could be a typo: \"worlds\" as plural or \"words\"? I think they want me to search Google for \"latest worlds model\" maybe a game or something. We need to use the google_search tool? There's no google_search tool, but instructions mention using google search via the context's google_search. There's no defined function. The problem: We don't have a tool to search Google. The instruction says there's a google_search API, but we can't actually call that. We probably should interpret that the user wants me to use the search tool that is configured in environment? But we don't see a function named google_search. Only shell, update_plan, apply_patch.\n\nThe user just said \"search google for its latest worlds model\". We cannot actually perform Google search. We can respond: \"I don't have access to Google...\" But we could try to simulate reading maybe from local docs? The user might want me to search? There's no function. Maybe we can ask them to clarify. The instruction says we should not assume we can call google. We should explain we cannot, and ask if they'd like to search themselves or provide details? But maybe the assistant should respond with a suggestion to run \"cargo test\" or code modifications? But the user explicitly: \"search google for its latest worlds model\". It's confusing. Since we can't access Google, respond: cannot internet. Suggest using local docs? Ask what they're searching for. Provide a general answer? They likely want to find the latest \"worlds model\" maybe the \"Worlds\" model used in gaming; maybe referencing the game \"Worlds\" model? Without clarity, I'd ask clarification.\n\nThus answer: I cannot access external web, but I can help gather info from repository or suggest. Ask for clarification."}],"encrypted_content":null}
